unique-factory Change Log
=========================

.. current developments

v0.2.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed cache inconsistency when factory function `create()` throws an exception.



v0.2.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added `get` overloads thats consume the `Key&&`.

**Changed:**

* Changed the `Value` that can be created by a factory. It now must use
  `std::enable_shared_from_this` (or equivalently implement
  `shared_from_this()`).

* Changed how values are stored in the factory cache. They are now stored as
  `const Value*` and not as `std::weak_ptr<Value>` anymore.

* Changed required C++ version. Now we need at least C++17.

**Performance:**

* Improved `get` which now uses only a single lookup and create call.



v0.1.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed a segfault when a factory gets destroyed before all its elements.



v0.1.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added release setup with rever.

* Added template argument to `UniqueFactory` to keep weak pointers alive even
  if all shared pointers to them have gone out of scope.

**Changed:**

* Moved header file to `unique-factory/unique-factory.hpp`.
